# CCS1477
Scripts for analysis conducted in CCS1477 project which led in the Sinclair er al manuscript:  

Experiments included in this repo are:

ChIP_241008: Chips for P300, INO80 & HA (INO80E) in UCHL5 & INO80E mut cells treated w/ CCS or DMSO, n=3.

ChIP_250415: These chips were initially processed by YCC then I made some additional plots. Chipped for H2A, H2AZ & H2AZac in dTAG +/- cells +/- drug, n=1.

ChIP_250612: These were chips for H2A, H2AZ, H2AZac, H2B & K7 in dTAG +/- cells +/- drug, n=3 (H2B & K7) and n=2 (H2A, H2AZ & H2AZac) to be combined w/reps from previous experiment (ChIP_250415).

ChIP_250804: Chips of K4 & K11, +/- dTAG both +/- drug, n=3.

CRISPR_230808: 3 cell lines: OPM2, OCI-AML3 & MV411 w/ DMSO, 12.5nm CCS or 50nm CCS for 17 or 20 days, n=1.

CRISPR_240328: Same as previous experiment (CRISPR_230808).

GEO_data: Re-processing and analysing of publicly available data for HEXIM, H3K4me3 & H3K27me3 to find overlap w/ bivalent genes (used Sparbier, et al for this).

GEO_PRJNA854916: Re-processing and analysis of H3K27ac chip and ATACseq data from collaborator's lab to define enhancers in steady state.

MACseq_240521: MV411 & OPM2 cell lines w/ SAFE, INO80-KO, INO80E-KO, UCHL5-KO or TFPT-KO at T0, 6h or 24h +/- drug, n=3 (150 samples in total).

Manchester_CRISPR: Re-processing of CRISPR data from collaborator's lab at Manchester; THP +/- drug at 17 & 20 days.

primary_CRISPR: 4 primary samples w/ sequencing at T0, 16 & 21 days.

RNAseq_241212: INO80E-KO cells +/- drug, +/- dTAG, n=3.
